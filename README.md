# Kevin.Tv
An homage to the days of Justin.tv, Kevin.Tv is a clone of the popular online streaming platform Twitch.tv. Built over the course of two weeks, the project leverages Ruby on Rails to build out the backend web API, while taking advantage of React/Redux to create the frontend components.

Screenshots and code snippets forthcoming. =)
